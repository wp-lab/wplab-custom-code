A handy little plugin to contain your custom code snippets.

== Description ==

Think of this plugin as an alternative to adding code snippets to the functions.php file in your child theme. Why? It keeps all of your changes in one location, independent of the other components that make up your web site. That means you can safely perform theme / plugin updates without the worry of losing your modifications as well as easily deactivating your customisations to check for conflicts.

*Note:* This plugin doesn't actually do anything on its own. It is purely a convenient place for you to store your own theme/plugin customisations.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Isn't this what child themes are for? =

Well, kind of. Sure, you can put your modifications in a child theme, but there are many places to download and use child themes. If you decide to use a child theme built by a third party and make modifications there, you would lose them when performing updates. Also if you make all your modifications in your own custom child theme then realise that you want to use a child theme from your favorite theme vendor, you'll have to move all of your modifications somewhere else. To avoid that hassle, use this plugin.

= Should I put all my customisations in this single plugin? =

That's entirely up to you. There's nothing to stop you from duplicating this plugin and changing the name. That way you could theoretically keep each of your customisations in their own individual plugins. This can be very handy when debugging, or if you want to quickly enable/disable a specific customisations temporarily.

= I can't remember installing this plugin. Who could have installed it for me? =

That would probably be our support staff from WP Lab. When a customer has special requirements that can only be fulfilled with some custom code snippets, then we will use this plugin to add these custom code snippets on your side. This way you always know where they are, and they won't accidentally be removed when you update your theme.
